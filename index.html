            <H2> About Grace Cabrera :</H2>
            <p>
             Hello, my name is Grace Cabrera. I am 21 years old, and just begining to to learn the ins and outs of html, javascript, and css.
             I was introduced to the world of computer science in the 8th grade. I remember we had to choose between art, band and computers.
             I chose computers because I remember always being really drawn to the world of technology, especially because as a young girl I feel as
             though I got the oppurtunity to watch technology grown at accelerated speeds. When taking the class we started off witch simple techniques
             to aid the speed at which we typed, then moved on to other subjects like html and css. In that class I created my first website and was
             hooked ever since. Now as I am older and able to afford my education on my own, I am exctied to finally follow the passion and I had once felt for 
             computer all that time ago as an adult. When coding although I do find it challenging I also find it extremely rewarding when finished.
